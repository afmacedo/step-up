# StepUp: a project to 'step up' projects

StepUp is an utility to manage versioning, based on source control management features (i.e. tags and notes of Git). That is, you don't need to keep track of your application version in a file anymore.
Initially it just supports Git as SCM. But more SCM's are planned in the future.

For now the only feature will help you to check the application version based on the default version pattern from StepUp.

The next (real soon) features to come are:
- create notes
- increment versions based on notes
- pattern of version defined by user
- and lots more
